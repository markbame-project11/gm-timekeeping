Steps to Install The Framework.
1. Checkout the latest framework code.
2. Locate the zipped sandbox file at <checkout_root>/docs folder.
3. Unzip file to a location. We will use 'C:/sandbox_app' as the location of our application.
4. Copy the files at <checkout_root>/code to 'C:/sandbox_app/lib/framework'. You can use other directory as the framework directory
but you need to change the framework location in 'C:/sandbox_app/index.php'.
5. Configure the web server. Please see below for a sample server configuration for apache.
	<VirtualHost *:80>	
		DocumentRoot "C:/sample_app"
		ServerName www.sample.com.local  # Sample server name
		DirectoryIndex index.php
		
		<Directory "C:/sample_app">
			AllowOverride All
			Allow from All
		</Directory>
	</VirtualHost>
6. Activate rewrite module in httpd.conf by removing the hash sign in line:
	LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so
7. There are two ways to apply url rewriting in your application. It depends whether you can edit the server configuration or not.
For users that can edit the server configuration, add the line below in your server configuration after the line you add in step 5.
	<Directory "C:/sample_app">
		RewriteEngine On
		RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} \..+$
		RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !\.html$
		RewriteRule .* - [L]
		RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php [QSA,L]
	</Directory>
For users that cannot edit the server configuration create a file and name it as '.htaccess'.
Add the line in '.htaccess':
	RewriteEngine On
	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} \..+$
	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !\.html$
	RewriteRule .* - [L]
	RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php [QSA,L]
The first method is recommended than the second method because '.htaccess' can make your website slower.
8. Restart web server and open http://www.sample.com.local to view the default application.
9. Happy coding...
